These are collection of scripts to help you interact with Jira. 

# Objective
* Learn how to interact with Jira using REST API.
* Solve your day to day problems.
* Have lot of fun.

# How to use the scripts?
* Set an environment variable called JIRATUTORIAL_AUTH which is used in the scripts. You can use ~/.bashrc or ~/.xinitrc file or any other way you are familiar with to do this. In this [video](https://www.ravisagar.in/videos/jira-rest-api-generate-api-token-and-base64-encoding) I have explained how to generate the token and base64 encode it.
